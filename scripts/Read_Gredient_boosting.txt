Gradient Boosting Script (gradient_boosting.R)
Problem Statement:
The goal of the gradient boosting script is to build and evaluate an XGBoost model for predicting stroke occurrence.

Script Overview:

Install and load necessary packages.
Set the working directory and load the engineered data.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Convert the data to matrix format for XGBoost.
Train the XGBoost model.
Evaluate the model using confusion matrices and AUC-ROC curves.
Save the trained model for future use.


Conclusion:
The gradient boosting script successfully builds and evaluates an XGBoost model, providing another powerful tool for predicting stroke occurrence. The model is saved for future use and deployment.

With these scripts, the project covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and gradient boosting, providing a comprehensive approach to building a robust stroke prediction model.
