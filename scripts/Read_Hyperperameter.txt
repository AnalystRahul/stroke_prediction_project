Hyperparameter Tuning Script (hyperparameter_tuning.R)
Problem Statement:
The goal of the hyperparameter tuning script is to optimize the parameters of the Random Forest model to achieve better predictive performance.

Script Overview:

Install and load necessary packages.
Set the working directory and load the preprocessed data.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Define a parameter grid for tuning.
Train the model using cross-validation.
Evaluate the tuned model.
Save the tuned model for future use.


Conclusion:
The hyperparameter tuning script optimizes the Random Forest model's parameters, improving its predictive performance.
