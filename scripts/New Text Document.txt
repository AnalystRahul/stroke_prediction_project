Feature Engineering Script (feature_engineering.R)
Problem Statement:
The goal of the feature engineering script is to create new features that might improve the predictive performance of the machine learning models.

Script Overview:

Install and load necessary packages.
Set the working directory and load the preprocessed data.
Handle missing values.
Create interaction terms between features.
Save the engineered data for further analysis.

Conclusion:
The feature engineering script successfully creates interaction terms between features, potentially improving the predictive performance of the models.
